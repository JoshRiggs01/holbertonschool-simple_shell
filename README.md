This code is a simple implementation of a shell in C.

The code begins by including several header files, which provide declarations
for various functions and constants used in the program. These headers are:

stdio.h: printf and fgets.

string.h: for manipulating strings - strlen and strcmp.

unistd.h: for interacting with the operating system - isatty and fileno.

sys/types.h: used in system calls -  pid_t and uid_t.

sys/stat.h: working with file attributes, such as stat and fstat.

sys/wait.h: waiting on and retrieving the status of child processes - waitpid.

fcntl.h: file descriptors - open and close.

dirent.h: reading directories, - opendir and readdir.

signal.h: handling signals - signal and raise.

stdlib.h: general-purpose tasks -  system and exit.

MAX_COMMAND_LENGTH -  which specifies the maximum length of a command that the
shell will accept.

The main function is then defined. It begins by declaring a string, command,
which will be used to store the user's input, and two integer variables,
length and result, which will be used later in the program.

The program then enters an infinite loop that will continue until the user
enters the "exit" command or the end of file is reached.

Inside the loop, the program first checks if it is running in a terminal
(using the isatty function) and, if so, prints a prompt for the user to enter a
command.

then the program uses "fgets" to read a line of input from the user, storing it
in the "command" string. If "fgets" returns NULL, indicating that the end of
file has been reached, the loop is exited.

Then the program calculates the length of the "command" string using "strlen"
and checks if the last character is a newline character (\n). If it is, it is
replaced with a null character (0) to remove the newline.

The program then uses "strcmp" to compare the "command" string to the string
"exit". If they are equal, the loop is exited. Otherwise, the program calls the
system function, passing it the command string as an argument.
This function executes the command specified by the string and returns the
status code of the command. If the system function returns a value of "127", it
indicates that the command was not found. In this case, the program prints an
error message to stderr and continues with the next iteration of the loop.
After the program prints the error message to "stderr" (standard error), it
continues with the next iteration of the loop. This means that it will go back
to the top of the loop and execute the code inside it again, starting with the
if statement that checks if the program is running in a terminal.

If the user has not entered the "exit" command, the program will continue to
prompt for input and execute commands in this manner until either the "exit"
command is entered or the end of file is reached.

When the loop exits, the main function returns a value of 0, indicating that
the program has terminated successfully.
