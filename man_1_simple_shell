NAME
       simple_shell - a simple command-line interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       simple_shell

DESCRIPTION
       simple_shell is a command-line interpreter that reads and executes commands from the user. It displays a prompt and waits for the user to enter a command. If the user enters the "exit" command, the interpreter exits. Otherwise, it tries to execute the command using the system() function. If the command is not found, it prints an error message to stderr.

EXAMPLES
       To start the interpreter, simply run the simple_shell command:

           $ simple_shell
           ($)

       To run a command, type it at the prompt and press Enter:

           $ simple_shell
           ($) ls
           file1 file2 file3

       To exit the interpreter, enter the "exit" (Ctrl + D) command at the prompt:

           $ simple_shell
           ($) Ctrl + D
           $
